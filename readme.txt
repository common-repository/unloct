== Description ==
Unloct is a microsubscription platform. Subscribers pay one monthly fee for unlimited access to an entire network of creators. When creators install this plugin, Unloct subscribers can log into the creators website. When they do, the creator gets paid. Anything that can fit on a website will work on the Unloct platform. Creators can choose how they use the log in system to engage with their fans. Put content behind the paywall, lock down comments so that only subscribers can post, etc.
